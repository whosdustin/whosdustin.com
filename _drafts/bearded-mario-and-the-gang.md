## Why
A couple of years ago I started a dropship t-shirt endeavor. At the time I was rocking a mean ass beard. One thing led to another and I ended up naming the site, Bearded Tees. The site started off strong and there were several incredible desgins on the site. I wanted a taste of the pie and started designing what I knew best, beards and nostalgic video game characters.

I designed Mario and Luigi as if they just hopped on to the hipster scene. Each with a distinct style in facial hair. I posted my work on such design sites as dribbble and forrst. I got a particularly good response from friends and family.

Fastword to 2016 and I decided to continue my desing efforts to complete the whole Mario gang. I started sketching all of the characters with different facial hair and sunglasses.
