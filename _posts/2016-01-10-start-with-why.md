Simon Sinek is brilliant and highly motivating. Simon's talk on how great leaders inspire action introduced me to an entirely different way to approach marketing. I now believe all branding initiatives, from personal branding to corporate branding, should be able to answer why before anything.

In addition to watching this video, I recommend reading the book [Start With Why](https://www.startwithwhy.com/), for a deeper understanding.
