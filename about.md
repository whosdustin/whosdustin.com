I'm a Shopify theme developer and a semi-professional traveler. I help companies all over the globe start their e-commerce site on the famous [Shopify](https://shopify.com) platform. I dedicate my work towards socially conscious brands who provide beauty and prosperity to the world.

In my spare time I work on some fun and sometimes meaningful projects. Those projects are [4Benefit News](https://4benefitnews.com), [Orlando Designers](https://orlandodesigners.info/), and many more.
