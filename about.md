I'm a frontend developer, designer, part-time starving artist, amateur traveler, and an undeniably talented doodler. Though I stare at lines of code daily, I appreciate the beauty and prosperity design can provide the world.

In my spare time I work on some fun and sometimes meaningful projects. Those projects are [4Benefit News](http://4benefitnews.com), [Gnarlacious](http://shop.gnarlacious.com), [Orlando Designers](https://orlandodesigners.info/), [Personal Resources](https://whosdustin.com/resources/), [The Game Namer](http://name.gnarlacious.com), and many more.
