Iâ€™m a Ui developer located in Orlando, FL, and have extensive knowledge in user experience. On top of that, I have years of design experience and was once nominated for a [CSS Design Award](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/whos-dustin/21950/). Currently, working at [Three21](http://three21creative.com).

Created [Gnarlacious](http://gnarlacious.com), a showcase of side projects. Current side projects include but are not limited to:

- [Orlando Designers Slack](https://orlandodesigners.info/) A website to display events and Slack Invitations.
- [Resources](https://whosdustin.com/resources/) - A site full of inspiring and useful links that I have aggregated over the years.
- [Middleman Data](https://github.com/gnarlacious/middleman-data) - A prototype template with user data
- [Name Game](http://name.gnarlacious.com) - A game naming generator
- [Ionicss](https://github.com/gnarlacious/ionicss) - A mixin based Sass framework.

If you're interested, here is [my resume](/cv/).
