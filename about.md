Dustin is a ui developer, part-time starving artist, amateur traveler, and an undeniably talented doodler. Though Dustin stares at lines of code daily, he appreciates the beauty and prosperity design provides the world.

Previous to being a developer, Dustin had years of design experience under his proverbial belt. 

Once nominated for a [CSS Design Award](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/whos-dustin/21950/). 

Created [Gnarlacious](http://shop.gnarlacious.com), a showcase of side projects. Current side projects include but are not limited to:

- [Orlando Designers Slack](https://orlandodesigners.info/) A website to display events and Slack Invitations.
- [Resources](https://whosdustin.com/resources/) - A site full of inspiring and useful links that I have aggregated over the years.
- [Middleman Data](https://github.com/gnarlacious/middleman-data) - A prototype template with user data
- [Name Game](http://name.gnarlacious.com) - A game naming generator
- [Ionicss](https://github.com/gnarlacious/ionicss) - A mixin based Sass framework.
