# WhosDustin.com

This is the source code for my personal website, [WhosDustin.com](https://whosdustin.com).

## Development

To run the site locally, you'll need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed. Once you have Bun installed, you can run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```
