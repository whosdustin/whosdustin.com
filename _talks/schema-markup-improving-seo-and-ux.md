I had an amazing opportunity to speak at the [Front End Orlando](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Orlando/events/233065517/) meetup about the basics of [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and how to implement it across the web. We talked about the benefits of adding the markup by creating visibility through search engine results.
