Let's eliminate the idea that designers should code and developers need to be design conscious. Creating a hybrid of both professions into a single individual smothers a persons ability to innovate and perfect their craft.

- Dive into tools that can help you communicate ideas.
- How to get consistency with your designs by building a style guide.
