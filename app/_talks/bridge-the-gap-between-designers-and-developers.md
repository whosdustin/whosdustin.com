title: Bridge (Don't Blend) the Gap Between Designers and Developers
date: 2016-3-3
---

Let's eliminate the idea that designers should code and developers need to be design conscious. Creating a hybrid of both professions into a single individual smothers a persons ability to innovate and perfect their craft.

I discussed ways to bridge the proverbial gap.

- Learn how to improve communication through a common language. (naming conventions)
- Dive into tools that can help you communicate ideas.
- How to get consistency with your designs by building a style guide.
