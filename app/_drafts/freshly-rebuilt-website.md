I have recently rebuilt my website after several years of an unused stagnant portfolio site. For a long time I have considered myself a hybrid UI designer and front-end developer. Along, with the rebuild of my site I am considering myself a full-time front-end developer with experience in UI design.

For over a year now I have been the lead Front-end developer for a company in Tampa; Bisk Education. While working alongside a small group of talented developers and designers I have found my passion as a front-end developer.
