 A while back I first designed my logo as a very minimal couple of triangles in the shape of a mountain range. I later changed it in order to look more like mountains. If you are reading this and donâ€™t believe they look like mountains than I screwed up big and you should contact me and let me know.

Now that we got that cleared up I wanted to explain why I chose mountains to represent who I am and what I believe in.

## Brief History
I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I spent my winters on the slopes around the New England area and my summers on Lake Winnipesaukee.
