Terms and conditions are written to better explain how to use my site properly.

## Just Read

This site is just text and some neat animations. There is nothing else you can do here. Just read shit.

## Also

To make this page a little bit more enjoyable here are some development terms and conditions I may use or have used in the past

### Terms

- __404__ -
- __CSS__ - Cascading Style Sheet, is what makes this site so pretty.
- __Wireframe__ - A visual guide to what the content may look like for when I build the site.
- __Favicon__ - It's the little picture in your browser tab.
- __Browser__ - It's the thing you are using to read this right now. I just pray it is not Internet Explorer. If it is, then this site must look awful, because I refuse to support it on my personal stuff.
- __Sitemap__ - A basic square and lines chart that shows a global, hierarchical view of a websiteâ€™s pages.

### Conditions

Conditions are simply "things" that are used in the form of a mathematical statement in order to evaluate a true or false value.

- __Foobar__ - A term derived from FUBAR, "F*ed Up Beyond All Recognition", is used together or separate (foo, bar) to act as examples of text in code.
- __Poop__ - C'mon, do I really need to define this for you? Although, I personally use this word is my example of text in code.
